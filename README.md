# 🐝 S21 Pro Honey Bee Hive — Open-Source Bitcoin Mining E-Waste Reimagined

**Open-source Bitcoin hardware can be a dirty and wasteful endeavor. Let’s clean it up.**

## ♻️ Why We Built This

Creating open-source Bitcoin mining hardware often involves tearing down perfectly good hardware, which can be incredibly wasteful. That’s why we believe sustainability must be at the core of this movement. By repurposing Bitcoin mining e-waste from the [@BITMAINtech](https://twitter.com/BITMAINtech) **S21 Pro** we aim to offset the environmental cost of liberating those BM1370 ASICs for projects like the **#Bitaxe**, **#NerdMiner**, and other innovative designs.

Pulling chips from a brand new fully functional hashboard to give them a more principled, open-source purpose, one that aligns with **Satoshi’s vision** comes at a cost, if we can move toward more sustainable, intentional, the e-waste may not be in vain.

## 🌍 A Path Forward

A cleaner, more sustainable path forward does exist but open-source Bitcoin mining developers can’t walk it alone.

Ultimately, the ideal scenario would be sourcing **affordable**, **sustainable**, and **open** Bitcoin mining chips directly from companies like [@jack](https://twitter.com/jack), [@blocks](https://twitter.com/blocks), and the **Proto team**. There’s also buzz around an affordable, highly capable solution from [@Auradine_Inc](https://twitter.com/Auradine_Inc).

## 🐝 From E-Waste to Bee Hive

To make use of as much e-waste from the S21 Pro as possible, closed hardware chips BM1370, that has contributed to some of the most exciting open-source Bitcoin mining projects we reimagined it as something entirely new:  
**A Bitcoin mining honey bee hive.**

### Key Features:

- **Top-mounted syrup feeder**  
  Provides nectar supplements during periods of dearth or environmental stress.

- **Observation window**  
  Allows for non-invasive hive monitoring, minimizing disruptions.

- **Bottom vent and hive beetle trap**  
  Promotes airflow and helps mitigate one of the most persistent threats in modern beekeeping.

- **Foundation-prepared hashboards**  
  Each hashboard is fitted with foundation strips and a layer of beeswax to help bees accept their high-tech new home.

- **Expandable entrance blocker system**  
  Future updates may include ports for pollen substitutes, quick-connect syrup feeders, and added ventilation for summer heatwaves.

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

To prevent overheating, we stacked three deep boxes with a lid, shielding the hive from direct sunlight. Current temperatures are ideal for testing, with no immediate concerns about cold weather.

## 📂 Open-Source and Ready to Build

The **S21 Pro Honey Bee Hive** design is fully open-source and available right here on our GitHub repository.

🐝 Reuse. Repurpose. Rebuild.  
⚡ Help honey bees. Improve the state of open source Bitcoin mining hardware.
